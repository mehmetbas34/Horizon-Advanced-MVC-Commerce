            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Horizon was designed for users who expect “everything I need in one place, clear delivery processes, and a secure account.”
                The goal is not only to display products but also to enable account management, order tracking,
                and easy access to promotions — covering the full e-commerce journey.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                To reduce the time people spend shopping online while increasing trust and transparency.
                In other words — making the “Find → Cart → Checkout” process as short, simple, and reliable as possible.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                Horizon brings together different categories such as electronics, fashion, home & living, and personal care
                to create a true “marketplace” experience. The fixed header, dropdown category menu, and account section you see above
                are designed to achieve this purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short: we simplify product discovery, shorten the checkout journey, and help users reach their goals without getting lost.

            <h2>Why Horizon?</h2>
            <p>
                Because on a single page you can search for products, browse categories, view your cart, and access your account.
                The biggest frustration in e-commerce is “getting lost in menus.” Horizon is built to eliminate exactly that.

        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>Customer First</h2>
            <p>
                Having visible contact info in the footer, an account section at the top, and a one-click shopping cart
                ensures customers never have to wonder “where should I click?”
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>Built for Sellers Too</h2>
            <p>
                The structure is not only for customers — it can easily adapt to multi-vendor marketplace models.
                Categories can be expanded, campaign sections added, and a blog area integrated to boost traffic.
